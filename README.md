# Regular Expressions

There are three notebooks in this exercise: 

* `Learning Regular Expressions.ipynb`: This is a gentle introduction to regular expressions in Python.
* `Regular Expressions.ipynb`: This notebook allows you to write and test regular expressions. Some of these
are quite hard! I've included solutions in there for you.
